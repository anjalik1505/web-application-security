# 1. Understanding Web Application Security Basics

Before diving into the technical aspects, it's important to understand the core principles of security:

**CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)**: Core principles that guide security practices.

**Authentication vs. Authorization:** Learn the difference between verifying identity (authentication) and granting permissions (authorization).

**Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensuring users only have the permissions they need.

**OWASP Top 10:** The most critical web application security risks.

**Recommended Study Material:**

**OWASP Top 10: **Essential resource for understanding the most common web application vulnerabilities.

**Mozilla Web Security Overview**: Covers a broad range of web security concepts.

**Web Security for Developers by Malcolm McDonald:** Book explaining security from a developer’s perspective.

**2. Common Web Vulnerabilities and Attack Types**

It’s essential to understand the most common vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them:

**Key Vulnerabilities:**

**Injection Attacks (SQL Injection, Command Injection): **Manipulating inputs to execute unauthorized commands.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): **Injecting malicious scripts into web pages.

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Forcing users to execute unwanted actions.

**Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** Accessing resources through insecure object access.

**Broken Authentication:** Improper implementation of authentication systems.

**Sensitive Data Exposure:** Exposing user data unintentionally.

**Recommended Study Material:**

OWASP Cheat Sheet Series: Provides quick references on securing web applications against these attacks.

Web Application Security: Exploitation and Countermeasures for Modern Web Applications: A hands-on approach to web security, including attack techniques and defenses.
